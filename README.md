It's a 11 month project of mine and I wanted to share it. I rewrote it 3 times because I lost the source code due to a hard drive corruption. It's mostly written in HTML and Python. You can modify it yourself, just install the packages and change the variables in the files and in the verification for the Discord bot. Also its very unefficent cause the css js and html is always in the same file i realeasd that like 1,5 month after beginning but didnt wanna recode the hole thing so i just capped going the js and css is 95% copy paste from the html files in the directory it was not that hard but it would have been better to organize and yea

Also, it's very inefficient because the CSS, JS, and HTML are always in the same file. I realized that like 1.5 months after beginning, but didn't want to recode the whole thing, so I just kept going. The JS and CSS are 95% copy pasted from the previous HTML files in the directory, so I just needed to adjust it a bit and write the HTML part. It was not that hard, but it would have been better to organize it.
And yeah.

enjoy or smth
